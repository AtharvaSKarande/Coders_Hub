    <string name="about_text">\t\t\tThis application has been developed by Atharva Sunil Karande,
        Gaurav Valmik Sonawane, Ninad Sunil Apte and Prajwal Vijay Mate, who are the students of
        \"Indian Institute of Information and Technology, Pune\".\n\t\t\tThe main motivation behind
        the idea of developing “ Coder’s Hub ” is to fulfil the need of the users that surf over the
        internet to find tools that can be used for improving their knowledge towards coding.
        \n\t\t\tIn Coder’s Hub we provide quizzes and interview related questions that are required
        for testing one’s coding skills.These quizzes come in the form of Multiple Choice Questions.
        The exciting part is that you are being awarded coins for every correct answer! These coins
        can be redeemed by purchasing new quizzes. So, no quiz is free!\n\t\t\tThe main motive
        behind this concept is to avoid users submitting answers without giving it sufficient
        time.\nBy implementing the concepts of Android Studio, Firebase and Java, we believe that
        the application can be beneficial for users trying to improve their skills as well as
        knowledge towards Computer Science.</string>
